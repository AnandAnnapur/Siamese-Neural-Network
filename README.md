# Siamese-Neural-Network
A *siamese neural network (SNN)* is a class of neural network architectures that contain two or more identical sub-networks. “Identical” here means they have the same configuration with the same parameters and weights. Parameter updating is mirrored across both sub-networks and it’s used to find similarities between inputs by comparing feature vectors.

# What does this project do 
In this project we are using siamese neural network to build a one shot image recognition model. the data used is in the training for the model mostly consists of my own images which were collected using webcam and then parallely trained with a dataset from kaggle 

## Image Collection
* In the first step create three folders in the data directory
* Next add the path in the code to capture the images in the file
* After doing the above steps now capture around 300(or more) images for trainig using the code

## app folder
In this i have bulit a basic UI using kivy library to display output

## What have I Done in This Project
So, in this project ive used a deeplearning model called as *siamese nerual network* for which the description is given above.
